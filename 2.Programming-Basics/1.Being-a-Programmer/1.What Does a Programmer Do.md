## What Does a Programmer Do?

A computer program is made of code written by a person called a **programmer**.
This code is created to build new projects or to add new features to existing software.

The main responsibility of a programmer is to write code and turn ideas into a series of instructions that a computer can follow. These instructions form the **source code** that produces applications or software systems.

## Core Responsibilities

In general, a programmer’s work includes:

* Designing solutions and planning how a program should work
* Writing code to implement those solutions
* Testing the program to make sure it behaves as expected
* Debugging to find and fix errors
* Maintaining and improving existing code over time

The main goal is to create programs that produce the behavior we want.

## Skills a Programmer Needs

To do this work effectively, a programmer needs several important skills:

* **Computational Thinking (CT)**
  A way of solving problems using concepts from computer science, encouraging logical, creative, and critical thinking.

* **Problem Solving**
  Programming often involves dealing with errors or unexpected behavior, so the ability to analyze problems and find solutions is essential.

* **Testing**
  A programmer should be able to test and evaluate software to ensure it works correctly and reliably.

* **Debugging**
  The ability to quickly identify the root cause of a problem and fix it efficiently.

* **Teamwork**
  Many programs are built in teams, so communication and collaboration are important to align goals and complete tasks effectively.

* **Patience and Persistence**
  Learning and mastering programming takes time. Problems can be complex, and progress often requires persistence and careful attention.
