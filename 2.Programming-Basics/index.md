# Programming Basics

This section is an introduction to programming, built on top of **Computational Thinking**.

If Computational Thinking is about *how to think*,
programming is about *how those thoughts are translated into instructions a computer can follow*.

You do not need to know a programming language to start here.
What matters first is understanding the ideas behind programming.

## What You Will Find Here

This section is divided into two parts:

### 1. Being a Programmer

This part focuses on the human side of programming:

* what a programmer does
* what skills and tools are needed
* how to choose a programming language

### 2. Programming Fundamentals

This part introduces the core building blocks used in most programming languages:

* variables and data types
* conditionals and loops
* functions and basic data structures
* debugging and problem-solving

These concepts appear in almost every programming language.

## A Note Before You Continue

Programming is not about typing code as fast as possible.
It is about thinking clearly, breaking problems down, and building solutions step by step.

Move slowly.
Understanding matters more than finishing.
