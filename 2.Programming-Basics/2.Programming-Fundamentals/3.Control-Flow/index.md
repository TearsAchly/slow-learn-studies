## Control Flow

By default, a program is executed **from top to bottom**, one line at a time.  
This linear execution is simple, but it is not enough to handle real-world problems.  
**Control flow** allows us to control **how and when** parts of a program are executed.

With control flow, a program can:

* repeat actions
* make decisions
* react differently based on conditions

## Why Control Flow Matters

Without control flow:

* programs would always run in a straight line
* there would be no decisions
* there would be no repetition

Control flow is what makes programs **dynamic and intelligent**, instead of static scripts.

## Types of Control Flow

In this section, control flow is divided into two main categories:

### 1. Loop

Loops are used to **repeat a block of code multiple times**.

They are useful when:

* an action needs to be performed repeatedly
* the number of repetitions is known or unknown

You can think of a loop like a **wheel that keeps turning** until a certain condition is met.

### 2. Conditional

Conditionals are used to **control the flow of a program based on conditions**.

They allow a program to:

* choose between different paths
* execute code only when a condition is true

Conditionals make programs responsive to different situations.

## How Control Flow Fits in Programming

Control flow connects many core concepts:

* variables and data types
* logical expressions
* program behavior

Almost every non-trivial program uses control flow in some form.
