## Loop

A **loop** is a control structure that allows a program to **repeat an action multiple times**.  
Loops are useful when we want to perform the same instruction repeatedly, such as:

* counting numbers
* processing data
* displaying repeated output

Without loops, we would have to write the same code over and over again.

---

## Why Loops Are Important

Loops help make programs:

* **more efficient**
* **shorter and cleaner**
* **easier to maintain**

Instead of repeating the same syntax many times, we only need to define:

* **what should be repeated**
* **when the repetition should stop**

---

## How Loops Improve Efficiency

Using loops reduces:

* duplicated code
* execution time
* human error

In general:

* fewer instructions → faster execution
* clearer logic → easier debugging

---

## How Loops Work (Conceptually)

Every loop usually has:

* a **starting point**
* a **condition** that controls repetition
* an **action** that is repeated
* a **way to stop**

As long as the condition is true, the loop continues running.

## Types of Loops

There are several kinds of loops in programming.
In this section, we will focus on two common ones:

* **For Loop**
  Used when the number of repetitions is known in advance.

* **While Loop**
  Used when repetition depends on a condition that is checked during execution.

Each type has its own use case and strengths.

---

## Example (Concept Only)

Instead of writing:

```text
print message
print message
print message
```

We can use a loop to repeat the instruction automatically.  
The exact syntax depends on the programming language, which will be explained in the next pages.

## What’s Next?

This section is divided into smaller parts:

* **For Loop** — repetition with a clear counter
* **While Loop** — repetition based on a condition

Take time to understand the concept of looping before moving on to syntax.

## Summary

* A **loop** repeats instructions automatically
* Loops reduce repetitive code
* They improve efficiency and readability
* Loops are a core part of control flow in programming

Understanding loops is essential before learning more advanced topics.
