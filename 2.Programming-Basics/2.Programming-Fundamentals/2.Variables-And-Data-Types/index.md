## Variables and Data Types

**Variables** and **data types** are fundamental concepts in programming.
They appear in almost every programming language and form the foundation of how programs store and process information.

Although the syntax may differ between languages, the **core ideas remain the same**.

Before moving on to conditionals, loops, or functions, it is important to understand these concepts clearly.

## What You Will Learn in This Section

This section is divided into smaller parts to make learning easier and more focused:

### 1. Variable

Learn what a variable is, why it exists, and how values are stored and updated in a program.

### 2. Data Types

Understand the different kinds of values that variables can hold, such as numbers, text, and logical values.

### 3. Variables and Data Types Together

See how variables and data types work together to form meaningful data in real programs.
