## What Is a Data Type?

A **data type** describes the kind of value stored in a variable.

It tells the computer:

* how the value should be stored in memory
* how the value should be interpreted
* what operations can be performed on it

Without data types, a computer would not know how to treat values correctly.

---

## Why Data Types Matter

Data types help programs:

* behave predictably
* avoid logical errors
* use memory efficiently

For example, adding two numbers is different from combining two pieces of text.

---

## Categories of Data Types

In most programming languages, data types are grouped into two main categories:

1. **Primitive data types**
2. **Composite (or complex) data types**

---

## Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types usually store **a single value**.

---

### Integer (int)

Stores whole numbers, either positive or negative.

Examples:

```text
10
-5
0
```

```python
count = 10
```

---

### Floating-Point Number (float)

Stores numbers with decimal points.

Examples:

```text
3.14
0.5
```

```python
price = 9.99
```

---

### Character (char)

Stores a single character.

```python
grade = 'A'
```

> Some languages treat characters differently or do not have a separate `char` type.

---

### String

Stores a sequence of characters (text).

```python
message = "learning programming"
```

Strings are commonly used to represent names, messages, and text input.

---

### Boolean

Stores logical values.

```python
is_active = True
```

Boolean values are often used in conditions and decision-making.

---

## Composite (Complex) Data Types

Composite data types are used to store **multiple values** in a single structure.

---

### Array

An **array** is a data structure that stores multiple values under one variable name.

You can think of an array as a **container** that holds several items.

In some languages:

* all elements in an array must have the same data type
* in others, elements can be of different data types

---

### Examples

**Python (mixed data types allowed)**

```python
data = [1, "apple", 3.14, True]
```

**C (single data type only)**

```c
int numbers[3] = {1, 2, 3};
```

---

## Choosing the Right Data Type

Choosing the correct data type:

* makes your program clearer
* prevents unexpected behavior
* improves performance

Always select the data type that best represents the value you want to store.

---

## In Short

* A **data type** defines what kind of value is stored
* Data types control how values behave
* They are divided into **primitive** and **composite**
* Every variable has a data type, explicitly or implicitly
