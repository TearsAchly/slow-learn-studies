## What Is a Variable?

A **variable** is a name used to store a value in a program.

You can think of a variable as a **label** attached to some data.
Instead of using the value directly every time, we give it a name so it can be reused.

---

## Why Variables Exist

Variables make programs flexible.

With variables, a program can:

* store information
* reuse values
* update values over time

Without variables, programs would be static and difficult to maintain.

---

## A Simple Example

```python
age = 20
```

In this example:

* `age` is the **variable name**
* `20` is the **value**

Now the program can use `age` instead of writing `20` everywhere.

---

## Variable Declaration and Assignment

When working with variables, there are two main actions:

### Variable Declaration

Declaring a variable means introducing its name to the program.

### Variable Assignment

Assigning a variable means giving it a value.

In some languages, declaration and assignment happen **at the same time**.
In others, they can be **separate steps**.

---

### Examples

**Python (combined)**

```python
count = 5
```

**C (separated)**

```c
int count;
count = 5;
```

The idea is the same. Only the syntax is different.

---

## Updating a Variable

The value of a variable can change while the program is running.

```python
score = 10
score = 15
```

The variable `score` now holds the value `15`, not `10`.

This ability to change values is what makes variables powerful.

---

## Variable Naming Rules

Most programming languages follow similar rules for naming variables:

* A variable name **must not start with a number**
* Numbers are allowed, but **not at the beginning**
* Do not use **reserved keywords** of the language
* Variable names are **case-sensitive**

  * `total` and `Total` are different
* For names with multiple words, common styles include:

  * `snake_case`
  * `camelCase`

---

### Examples

```text
# Valid
user_name
totalScore
count2

# Invalid
2count
user-name
print
```

---

## Choosing Good Variable Names

Good variable names make code easier to understand.

Compare:

```python
x = 30
```

and

```python
age = 30
```

The second example clearly explains **what the value represents**.

---

## In Short

* A **variable** stores a value
* A variable has a **name** and a **value**
* The value of a variable can change
* Clear variable names improve readability

Understanding variables is the first step toward understanding how programs work.
