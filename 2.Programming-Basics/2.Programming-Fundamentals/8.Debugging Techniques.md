## Debugging Techniques

In everyday language, a **bug** means an insect or pest.
In programming, a **bug** is an error or flaw in a program that causes it to behave **incorrectly or unexpectedly**.

A bug does not only appear as a program crash.
It can also appear as:

* a game character passing through walls
* an interface element not displaying correctly
* icons or emojis appearing as empty squares
* features not working as intended

---

## Reducing the Number of Bugs

While bugs cannot be completely avoided, they can be **minimized**.

Some common practices include:

### 1. Good Team Communication

Clear communication and good project management help teams:

* understand requirements correctly
* reduce misunderstandings
* catch problems early

A healthy team workflow often leads to fewer bugs.

---

### 2. Testing

Testing helps identify problems before users encounter them.

Common types of testing:

* **Alpha testing**
  Performed in early development stages by the development team.
* **Beta testing**
  Performed by a wider group of users before public release.

---

### 3. Software Development Methodology

Using a structured development approach helps reduce bugs.

One common methodology is **Agile**, which focuses on:

* continuous development
* frequent feedback
* small, incremental improvements

---

### 4. Collaboration Tools

Using collaboration platforms improves coordination and code quality.

Examples:

* Version Control Systems (VCS) such as **Git**
* Platforms like **GitHub** or **GitLab**

These tools help track changes, review code, and fix bugs collaboratively.

## What Is Debugging?

**Debugging** is the process of:

* identifying errors
* analyzing their causes
* fixing or removing them

The goal of debugging is to ensure the program works as intended.

---

## Types of Debugging

There are generally **two main approaches** to debugging:

1. Manual debugging
2. Debugging with tools (code editors / debuggers)

---

## 1. Manual Debugging

Manual debugging involves understanding how the program works and carefully examining its logic.

Common steps include:

* identifying the error
* locating the source of the problem
* analyzing the affected lines of code
* checking whether the bug impacts other parts of the program
* verifying assumptions using tests
* fixing the bug

This approach requires strong understanding of the program’s behavior.

---

## 2. Debugging with Tools

Modern code editors and IDEs provide built-in debugging tools.

These tools allow programmers to:

* set breakpoints
* inspect variable values
* step through code line by line
* observe program flow

Examples of debugging tools:

* **GDB**
* **DDD**
* IDE debuggers (Eclipse, VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.)

---

## In Short

* A **bug** is an error that causes incorrect behavior
* **Debugging** is the process of finding and fixing bugs
* Bugs can be reduced through good practices and testing
* Debugging can be done manually or with specialized tools

Debugging is not just about fixing errors —
it is about **understanding how programs really work**.
