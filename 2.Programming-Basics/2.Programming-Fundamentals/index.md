# What Is Programming?

Programming is the process of creating programs by writing a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do.<br>
In everyday life, many things we use are powered by programs.
For example, when buying something through an application—searching for items, checking out, and tracking deliveries—every step in that process is driven by lines of code.

These lines of code are written using specific languages that computers can understand.

## Levels of Programming Languages

In general, programming languages can be grouped into three levels:

### 1. Machine Language

The lowest-level language, directly understood by the computer.
It consists only of binary numbers:

```
0 and 1
```

---

### 2. Assembly Language

A simplified representation of machine language that is easier for humans to write and read.

Examples of instructions include:

```
MOV, ADD, SUB
```

---

### 3. High-Level Languages

Languages that are easier for humans to understand and use.

There are many high-level programming languages, each designed for different purposes and use cases.
Every language has its own strengths and areas where it is best applied.

For example:
- **Python** — often used for learning, automation, data analysis, and machine learning  
- **JavaScript** — commonly used to build interactive websites and web applications  
- **Java** — widely used in large-scale applications and Android development  
- **C++** — used in systems programming, game development, and performance-critical software

## Do We Need to Learn All Programming Languages?

No.

Each programming language serves a specific purpose.
Becoming a good programmer does not mean mastering every language—it means understanding the **core concepts** and the **way of thinking** behind them.

It is better to learn a few languages deeply than many languages superficially.

If you are still unsure which language to choose:

* align it with your goals, or
* choose based on the career path you are interested in

## A Note on Learning Programming

Programming is not about memorizing syntax.
It is about learning how to think, how to break down problems, and how to design solutions—skills that are closely connected to **Computational Thinking**.
