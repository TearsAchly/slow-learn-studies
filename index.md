# knowledge crumbs

Just a collection of knowledge crumbs I've picked up along the way.  
Keeping the learning trail visible and the sources remembered.  
Learning at my own pace—as long as it sticks.

## Current Milestones

### [**First Step: Computational Thinking**](https://tearsachly.is-a.dev/slow-learn-studies/1.Computational-Thinking-(CT)/)

My first step on this trail.  
Before diving into the noise,  
I’m learning how to think, break down complexity, and find the logic in the chaos.

### [**Second Step: Programming Basics**](https://tearsachly.is-a.dev/slow-learn-studies/2.Programming-Basics/)

After learning how to think, this section focuses on turning those thoughts into instructions a computer can follow.     
It covers both the mindset of being a programmer and the fundamental concepts behind writing code.


### [**Third Step: Mindfulness**](https://tearsachly.is-a.dev/slow-learn-studies/3.Mindfulness/)

A step back to move forward.  
This section focuses on attention, awareness, and decision-making—skills that support clearer thinking and deeper learning.  
By learning when to slow down, observe, and reflect, I aim to think more deliberately, stay focused, and make better choices along the learning journey.
