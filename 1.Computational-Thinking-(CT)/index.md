# Computational Thinking

**Computational Thinking (CT)** is a way of thinking that occurs when we **formulate a problem** and **design strategies** to choose solutions that are **effective, efficient, and optimal**.

CT can also be understood as the **ability to think systematically** by using **technology or computers as supporting tools**—although the thinking process itself does not always require a computer.

## Simple Example

Imagine you get **bitten by mosquitoes**:

* If there is only one, you can simply slap it.
* If there are many, you might use an **electric mosquito racket**.
* But if you want to **sleep peacefully**, using **mosquito repellent** makes much more sense than staying awake all night 😄

The solution should **match the problem**.
You would not **burn down your house** just to get rid of mosquitoes—yes, the mosquitoes would be gone, but so would your house 😅

Without realizing it, you are:

* comparing possible solutions,
* choosing the most reasonable one,
* and considering efficiency and impact.

That is **Computational Thinking** in action.

## Elements of Computational Thinking

1. **Decomposition**
   Breaking a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts.
   
2. **Abstraction**
   Focusing on important information while ignoring unnecessary details.

3. **Pattern Recognition**
   Identifying similarities or patterns from previous problems.

4. **Algorithm**
   Creating clear, step-by-step instructions to solve a problem.

## Conclusion

* CT is a **fundamental thinking process**.
* CT is a **way of thinking toward solutions**.
* CT is **conceptualization**, not programming.
* CT can be applied in **all fields**.

  * In **IT**, CT produces programmable solutions.
  * In **non-IT fields**, CT helps approach solutions when computation is needed.

CT is a form of **literacy**.
It **cannot be learned only by reading definitions**.
CT must be **practiced continuously**—reading and understanding concepts is not enough.
Only through regular practice can this way of thinking become a habit.
