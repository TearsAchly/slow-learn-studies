/*
 * Program Title: Addition of Added Series
 * Author: Achly
 * Date: July 2023
 * Description: This program calculates the sum of integers from 0 to a specified upper limit N and prints the series.
 *
 * Logic:
 *        1. Declare and initialize an integer variable `N` to define 
 *           the upper limit for the integer series.
 *        2. Initialize an integer variable `sum` to store the total sum, 
 *           starting from 0.
 *        3. Use a `for` loop to iterate through integers from 0 to N.
 *        4. In each iteration, print the current integer value.
 *        5. If the current integer is less than N, print a plus sign "+" 
 *           to indicate the continuation of the series.
 *        6. Add the current integer to the `sum` variable.
 *        7. After the loop completes, print the total sum of the series.
 *
 * Preconditions:
 *        - The variable `N` must be a non-negative integer.
 *
 * Postconditions:
 *        - The program outputs the series of integers from 0 to N 
 *          followed by the total sum.
 *
 * Edge Cases:
 *        - If N is set to 0, the program will output "0 = 0".
 *
 * Program Flow:
 * 1. Initialize `N` with the upper limit for the series.
 * 2. Initialize `sum` to 0.
 * 3. Enter the `for` loop to iterate from 0 to N.
 * 4. Print each number and the appropriate plus sign as needed.
 * 5. After the loop, print the calculated total sum.
